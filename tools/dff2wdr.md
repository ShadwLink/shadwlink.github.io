**NOTE**: This is a public beta, and as such it is crucial that you backup all files you replace with models created with dff2wdr! I wont be held responsible for any loss of files that may result due to use of dff2wdr.

**Requirements**  
– You need to have Java installed  
– Version 1.0, 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 1.04 of GTAIV.exe

**Usage**  
– Make sure all vertices have a texture applied.  
– Click “File-&gt;Open Stock/Custom DFF”.  
– Select the file you want to convert/Select the directory that contains the dff files you want to convert.  
– Files will be saved as &lt;DFFNAME&gt;.wdr

**Tip**: Use WDR Analyze and check if there are just as many Shaders as Geometrys,  
If thats not the case dont import the model in IV it will crash.

**Known issues**  
– You cant convert weapons. (weapons contain bones)  
– You cant convert peds/player. (Also contain bones)
