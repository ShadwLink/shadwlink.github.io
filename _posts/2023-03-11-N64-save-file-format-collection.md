For one of my (many) side projects I required information about save file formats for N64 games. After some searching I noticed that only a few of the most popular ([Zelda OOT](https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/oot/Save_Format), [Mario 64](http://bryc.github.io/sm64eep/) etc) games are documented across the web, but there was not a single place that contained documentation, let alone documentation for all N64 games.

I started to document the currently available information into a single [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KilianSteenman/N64-Save-file-formats) in consistent [010 templates](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/repository/templates/), which are very easy to read even without 010 editor, for everyone to learn from and add to. 

As of writing this post the repo only contains a template for Mario 64, 1080 Snowboarding and the start of Diddy Kong Racing, but I am planning to add more in the future.
