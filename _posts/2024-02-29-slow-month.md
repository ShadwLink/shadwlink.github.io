I am lucky this month has an extra day, I almost forgot to post something in February! 

Things have been a bit slow this month due to a nice skiing trip and life in general. Work kept me busy!

But I did have a bit of time to work on a project. This time it wasn't OASE but a Chip-8 Emulator for the N64. I've already written a Chip-8 emulator in Kotlin Multiplatform, but for the N64 I had to write it in C. Even though my C isn't great it was a much nicer experience then the Kotlin version. Kotlin just isn't nice to work with when dealing with unsigned types or binary operators, which are used a lot when dealing with file formats or emulation. 

Anyway the emulator is not fully done yet, currently working on input mapping support once I've got a fully working version I'll put the emulator on my GitHub.
