I really need to post more often. So what have I been upto lately?

Iâ€™ve been working a lot on Vice IV and optimizing my plugin collision exporter for this.[![](/assets/images/post/vice_iv_airport2.png)](/assets/images/post/vice_iv_airport2.png)

Also Iâ€™ve been working on a new version of Shadow Mapper. Itâ€™s not much at this stage but it can render wdr/dff files and a lot of coding has been done that canâ€™t be seen, like IPL, IDE and GTA.dat loading. Iâ€™ll upload some screenshots when it renders a IV Map properly!

Hope that was enough info to keep you satisfied for a while ðŸ™‚
