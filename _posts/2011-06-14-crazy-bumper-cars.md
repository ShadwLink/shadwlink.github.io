I’ve been busy on a game for college for a couple of months now. After 5 months of development it’s finally done! Everything was made by our team that exists of 2 programmers and 3 designers. We used the XNA framework. So it runs on both the PC and Xbox 360.

It’s called Crazy Bumper Cars (CBC) and it is a mix between Mario kart and Monkey Ball. You can check out the progress blog [here](/games/crazy-bumper-cars) if you’re interested!
