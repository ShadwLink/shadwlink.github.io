After careful consideration and deliberation, I am pleased to announce that the minimum viable product (MVP) for the trophy application has been finalized. However, there are still a few tasks that need to be completed to achieve this MVP, including N64 game detection outside of the root directory, finalizing the list of trophies for these games, and creating a proper UI.

Despite these remaining tasks, the MVP of the trophy application will still feature automatic game detection and three tiers of awards - Bronze, Silver, and Gold - with plans to introduce Platinum awards at a later date. Additionally, the application will launch with support for a number of iconic games, including 1080 Snowboarding (US), Mario Kart 64 (US), Super Mario 64 (US), Super Smash Bros (US), and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (US).
