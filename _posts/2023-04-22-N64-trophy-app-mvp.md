I'm happy to say that I've got the minimum viable product (MVP) for the trophy app all set. But, I still need to finish up a few things before it's completely good to go. This includes being able to detect N64 games even if they're not in the root folder, figuring out all the trophies for the current set of games, and tweaking the user interface.

Don't worry, the trophy app MVP will still be pretty sweet. It'll automatically find your games and give you three types of trophies: Bronze, Silver, and Gold (with plans for Platinum later on). Plus, when it launches, it'll already support some classic games like 1080 Snowboarding (US), Mario Kart 64 (US), Super Mario 64 (US), Super Smash Bros (US), and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (US).
