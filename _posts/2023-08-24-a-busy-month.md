This month has been weird. 

To start I did a little game jam challenge. I had a look at all previous Ludum Dares en picked the theme of the first one, gave myself a week to come up with an idea and creating a working prototype. To put it short, I've created a small little game in Unity, I'll create a longer post about it some day.

Then something big happened; I became dad for the second time ðŸ¥°! As you can imagine taking care of the little girl takes up most of my time!

I did find some time to start rewriting the renderer of OASE, I should really creats a project page for OASE and create more videos.

This is it for now, will write another post when the dust settles.
