The end of 2024 is approaching rapidly and that's a good moment to take a step back and look what I've done in 2024.

### Last year's ambitions

But first lets go back to the end of last year, where I actually wrote a [blog post with possible projects for 2024](https://www.shadow-link.nl/2024/).

__Game using OASE__

I can be short about this one, there is no game using the OASE engine, nor is there a game using any other engine. Those game projects still live somewhere in my mind...

__Elevating OASE VC to the Next Level__

The year started great for OASE VC with [support for wav and MP3 playback and even radio stations](https://www.shadow-link.nl/we-are-on-the-air/). The model loading and rendering code also got a complete overhaul, sadly this triggerred unexplainable crashes that eventually drained my OASE energy. Maybe next year will be the year of OASE?

__Wake-Up Light__

The wake up light is a project where I did make progress. 
- Arduino hardware ✅
- Arduino software ✅
- Mobile app (Android & iOS) ✅

That looks like a finished project doesn't it? Sadly the last step isn't done yet, actually putting the hardware inside a kid friendly case. I've been contemplating between buying an of the shelf light and designing / 3D printing something myself, currently leaning towards the latter to make it as personal as possible.

__III Era Modding YouTube Channel__

I still think this is a great idea, now if I would just put some effort into this...

### So, what did I end up doing in 2024?

You never know what life will bring you. One thing I did notice was the lack of energy and time to work on my side projects, who thought having a second kid would have this impact?

Even though most of the ideas I had for 2024 did not become reality, I still got some stuff done. Lets take a look.

__Chip-8 emulator for the N64__

In the past I've created a [Kotlin multiplatform emulator for Chip-8](https://github.com/KilianSteenman/KEmulation), for some reason I thought it was a fun idea to build a [Chip-8 emulator for N64](https://github.com/KilianSteenman/Chip8-N64). The basics are working, rom loading, opcode interpreter and even basic key binding.

__Shadow-MSP - gta3sc support__

[The Intellij plugin](https://github.com/KilianSteenman/Shadow-MSP) that I wrote to create and compile missions scripts got support for [gta3sc](https://github.com/thelink2012/gta3sc), an awesome open source compiler that is able to compile the original mission script sources to the well known main.scm file. The plugin adds syntax highlighting, refactoring and find usages support for `.sc` files. As a bonus I've also contributed [MacOS support](https://github.com/thelink2012/gta3sc/pull/132) in gta3sc.

__Game development__

Godot engine has peaked my interest this year. It seems to be a very capable engine, is open source and has support for C# besides GDScript. I've created a little playground project and have been following some tutorials. Nothing interesting came out of this yet, but you never know what I might end up creating.

__Exploring Kotlin multiplatform for Web__

I've been playing around with Kotlin / Compose multiplatform, my personal website is now build using this tech. It has some downsides, but has potential for certain usecases. I should probably write a dedicated blog post about this.

### Final thoughts

Looking back, 2024 was a good year. Even though I did not work on the projects I planned, some projects got some nice updates and I learned some new tricks that I can use for 2025!
