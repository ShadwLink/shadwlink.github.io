It’s been a while since my last post. In the mean time I’ve released version 0.2.4 of Shadow’s Plugin also I want to let you guys know I am working on a new total conversion mod together with GTARandom. It’s called Vice IV, which as you might have guessed, put’s the Vice City map into GTA IV. More info about this mod can be found at [GTAForums](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=463556) and [the project page](http://shadow-link.nl/) on my website.
