(3DS Max users should not read this as the word sketchup makes them cry most of the time)

A little while ago I wanted to export some of my sketchup models to IV. I found it to much of a hassle to do the Sketchup -&gt; 3DS Max conversion every time I wanted to export or update something so I decided to quickly write an exporter to improve my workflow. If anyone is interested in it I’ll make it suitable for release and release it.

Current features:  
– Export WDR (Really basic)  
– Export WBD/WBN  
– Export WPL  
– Export IDE (WIP)

I know there are a few sketchup modders out there so if you’re interested in this let me know.

Note: Sketchup Pro is not required because it’s a ruby plugin.
