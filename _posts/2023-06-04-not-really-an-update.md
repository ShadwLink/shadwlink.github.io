It's been a busy month (If you missed it, TOTK has been released) and I haven't found much time to focus on any of my side projects. I even failed my goal of posting at least one blog post every 2 weeks.

The little bit of time I did have I used to fix some wrongly implemented trophies on 1080 Snowboarding and updated my [KEmulation](https://github.com/KilianSteenman/KEmulation) project which now shares the entire UI code between Android, desktop and iOS too.

I've been thinking about just releasing the current state of the N64 trophy system and let people try it out and give feedback.
