The end of IV has come, last week GTA V finally arrived. Research on the formats used in V has already begun and a lot of people are already working on small tools. Because I’ve not been very active in the modding scene I would like to contribute in a different way to the modding community…

I am going to Open Source my IV modding tools, starting with Shadow-Mapper (code is pretty bad so be warned). The code can be read, run, improved and learned from by everyone. A lot of the V file formats will probably be familiar to the files used in IV. So some code might still be useful. Next to that I will also improve some of the current projects or try to implement GTA V support into them. The source can be found on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/ShadwLink). I am still trying to get the code to build again so keep this in mind.

If there is any particular project of mine you would like to see on GitHub just let me know and I will upload it.
