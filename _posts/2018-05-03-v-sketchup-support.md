Version 0.5.0 of Sketchup2IV is now available. This release contains basic support for ODR and OTD export for V. I still have a bit of trouble getting OBN support to work, but it should be available soon.

To export to V open the extensions menu, select GTA Version, and select GTA: V.

As itâ€™s now possible to export to multiple GTA versions, I renamed the exporter to [Sketchup2GTA](/tools/sketchup2gta).
