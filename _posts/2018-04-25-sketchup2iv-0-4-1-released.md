Iâ€™ve fixed some big issues that caused problems when importing the OpenFormats files.

The following fixes are included in release 0.4.1:

- Fixed OpenFormats version in mesh files
- Select export path for WPL files
- Select export path for IDE files
- Filter duplicates on IDE export
- Fix UV coordinates

As always the new version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ShadwLink/Sketchup2GTA/releases).
