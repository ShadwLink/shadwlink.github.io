Ever wanted to play pool with more than two players? We got the perfect game for you!

_Pocket ball_

Pocket ball is a variant of pool that can be played with 2-6 players (we think the ideal player count is 4). 
All you need is a pool table and 9 pieces of poker chips (or beer caps) for each player.

I've created a [page](/games/pocket-ball) where I'll write down a guide on how to play the game.
