I was tired of waiting for a sco editor so decided to code one myself. It’s very basic but it does the job for now.

*What can you do with it?* Well you can decompile the current missions and adjust them. OR create your very own missions from scratch. Sounds awesome right?

*Oh come on man, now I want it!* Sorry, you’ve got to wait a little longer. It’s still in early beta stage and doesn’t decompile every script without problems and doesn’t work with the latest patches.

For now you can download a cleaned script.img for version 1.0 and 1.0.1.0 (I haven’t tested this on new versions so it might work on newer versions) [Cleaned Scripts.img](https://shadow-link.nl/download/cleaned-scripts-img/ "Version 1.0")
