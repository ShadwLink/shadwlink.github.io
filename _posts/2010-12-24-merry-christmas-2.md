Tonight it’s christmas night, so I want to wish you all a Merry Christmas! I hope you’ll get lots of presents and get together with your family and friends (we should be able to life without IV Modding for atleast a day, right?).

This could be seen as a little Christmas present, I’ve joined the russian modding team! I hope together we can make some awesome tools to get this game fully moddable.

Again have a nice Christmas,
