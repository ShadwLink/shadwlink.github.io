San Andreas support is now available in Sketchup2GTA! 

Starting from [pre-release 0.7.0](https://github.com/ShadwLink/Sketchup2GTA/releases/tag/v0.7.0) it's possible to export DFF, TXD, COL, IPL and IDE files in the San Andreas format. The COL file is still using the VC format, I've added the SA specific format to the projects roadmap. But first it's GTA III's turn!
