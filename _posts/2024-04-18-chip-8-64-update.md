I've found this amazing [Chip-8 database](https://github.com/chip-8/chip-8-database/) that contains a huge set of rom info; this info includes common button mappings, color mappings and supported platforms. I am planning to use this database to provide pre-build button configs for all original Chip-8 roms in the database.

If I am being honest, I am a little bit tired of this project. Chip-8 doesn't interest me at all, the only part I enjoy is the emulation and N64 part. Still, I'm determined to push through and wrap something up this year.
