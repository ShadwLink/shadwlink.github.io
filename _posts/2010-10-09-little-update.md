It’s been a week since I released the first version (0.1.0) of Shadow’s Plugin. I’ve released four bug fixes since then. At this moment I can say that the import function is pretty stable.

Here is a screen from City\_Poke912 to show what the script is capable of!

The first export test (0.2.0) will be released somewhere next week! You’ll be able to export WDR files with it.

On another note, I’ve been making some awesome progress on the most used collision type for buildings.
