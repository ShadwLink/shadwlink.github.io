It’s the last day of the year already. This year went by pretty fast. It’s been a busy year in which I’ve released a few tools. Exactly a year ago I released Shadow-Mapper 0.1 and ofcourse I’ve also released Shadows-Plugins, the very first max importer/exporter for IV files.

What would you like to see for next year? A help area where I’ll help people out with IV modding problems? Improved tools from me and the Russians? Let me know what you would like to see on my website in the comming year.

Happy new year!
