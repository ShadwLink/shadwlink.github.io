Hey, N64 fans! I have a small update regarding the N64 Trophy app. The app is almost ready for release, and I'm just finishing up a few last tasks before I can share it with you.

One of the exciting updates is that the app can now locate ROMs that are saved in subdirectories. This means that all your games will be detected even the ones burried deep in a subdirectory.

In addition, I've given the app's user interface a fresh new look.

While we're getting close to release, there are still a few trophies left to implement for Mario 64, Super Smash Bros, and Zelda OOT. 

Stay tuned for the release date announcement, and get ready to start unlocking those trophies!
