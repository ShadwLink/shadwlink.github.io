I’ve released yet another update for Shadow’s Plugins! Why is this release so special that I dedicate a post for it?

It’s because this version contains WBD export! It’s the WBD exporter I’ve used in the movie I’ve posted earlier. So head over to the download section and put your custom models ingame again, but this time WITH collisions!

Other updates that are included in this version:

- Added support for gta\_spec shader
- Made adding support for shaders a lot easier
