Oh man, it's starting to become a bad habit that I post something at the end of the month. I need to step up my game; otherwise, I won't accomplish those New Year's resolutions.

Anyway, I've spent some time improving my Chip-8 emulator. It now has basic program selection, and the input mapping is fully working, even if not very intuitive yet.
