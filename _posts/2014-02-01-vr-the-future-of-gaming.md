I’ve not been active in the GTA Modding community lately. My interest has changed. I’ve got a full time job as a software developer, so I don’t have much spare time to work on my own projects. Recently something different than GTA has triggered my interest. The[ Oculus Rift](http://oculusvr.com), since the day the kickstarter launched I’ve followed it with much interest because it’s always been a dream of me to be “inside” the game. My girlfriend bought me a developer kit for my birthday &lt;3 and I love it. It’s everything I thought it would be. It still has a couple of flaws but I think it can change the way people see gaming and watch movies. I personally can’t wait for DK2/CV1 to arrive.

**What I’ve been doing with the devkit**

There are a lot of demos out there that are really showing the power of the Rift, I showed it to all my friends and they all think it’s amazing even the friends that are not into gaming. As a developer I wanted to build something for the Rift myself. I started working on a small project to get the Rift to work in C# using OpenTK. You can find it on my [Github ](https://github.com/ShadwLink/RiftTK)account if you want to know how I did it. Using that project as a base I started working on a game, a game that I’ve always wanted to experience as if I was actually there, my favorite game of all time (maybe you can guess it already) The legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I’ve played and completed that game hundreds of times on the N64 and Gamecube, but I could never have thought I would once play it in VR. I’ve been working on a project that loads the N64 Zelda rom and makes it playable with the Rift. For now it only loads the map and gives you the ability to walk around. The rendering is still a bit off, but don’t worry about that, I will get it right eventually. 

Oh and that’s not it. I want it to be a full VR Experience. I’ve backed two more kickstarter projects that I think are amazing and I can’t wait for them to arrive. The [Virtuix Omni](http://virtuix.com) will make it possible to walk around in Hyrule and the [STEM System](http://sixense.com/hardware/wireless) will make it possible to swing your sword and kill Ganondorf once and for all.

Thanks for reading, I’ve created a [project page](/games/zelda64-vr) with a roadmap for this project. Also I should give a lot of credit to [spinout182](http://www.spinout182.com). His website contains valuable information regarding Zelda64, without his website I wouldn’t have known where to start.
