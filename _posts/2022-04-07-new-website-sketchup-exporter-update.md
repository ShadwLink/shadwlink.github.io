As you might have noticed the website got a small reskin. I've moved the blog from dedicated hosting to GitHub pages, and I love it (Who needs a CMS if you can use Git!).

But that's not all, I've also picked up a bit of modding by adding Vice City (DFF/COL/TXD) export support to the SketchUp plugin. Head over to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ShadwLink/Sketchup2GTA/releases/) and download the [preview version](https://github.com/ShadwLink/Sketchup2GTA/releases/tag/v0.6.0).
