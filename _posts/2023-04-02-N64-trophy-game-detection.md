I have to confess, the screenshots in my previous post where made by reading embedded save data in the rom instead of the Everdrive SD card. But this has now been fixed, the program now detects installed games automatically by scanning the SD card for supported games _(root dir only for now)_.

Here is a screenshot of the detection in action. Can you spot the newly supported game [*hint*](https://github.com/KilianSteenman/N64-Save-file-formats/blob/main/mario-kart-64.bt)?
