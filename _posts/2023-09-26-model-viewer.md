People that follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Shad0w_Link) might have already seen some screenshots. I've been working on a simple model viewer for DFF files. 

This viewer uses a completely new DFF loader (which is a lot more memory efficient) and simpler way of rendering. At this point there is basic animation support for GTA: III models and VC support is in the works.

I am planning to incorporate the new loading and rendering code into OASE.
