In part 2 of this series we'll take a look at some more complex models. First up we'll take a look at a model that uses multiple geometries, this way we can see how the hierarchy is constructed. In the second part we'll take a look at a model which has a skeleton, skeletons can be used to animate skinned meshes which are used in Vice City.

## Multi geometry model

Let's take a look at the model `SCHAIR.dff`. This model is the chair used by Sonny in the intro cutscene of Vice City. This model can be found in the `gta3.img` archive, you'll need an image editor to extract the model file from the archive.

If we print the RenderWare structure you can see that the tree is a bit bigger compared to the `arrow.dff` that we used in the previous part.

```

The main difference is the amount of frames (4) and geometries (2), accompanied by 2 atomic sections to match the geometry entries to a frame.

Let's start with taking a look at the frame data inside the FrameList.

__Frame 1__
```
Name: "schair_dummy"
ParentIndex: -1
```

__Frame 2__
```
Name: "schair"
ParentIndex: 0
```

__Frame 3__
```
Name: "schrbot"
ParentIndex: 1
```

__Frame 4__
```
Name: "schrtop"
ParentIndex: 1
```

In this case `schair_dummy` is the root node which is located at index `0`. The parent index is set to `-1` which indicates it does not have a parent. `schair` on the other hand has a parent index of `0`, which indicates that it's parent is `schair_dummy`. Last but not least we have 2 frames called `schrbot` and `schrtop` (Sonny Chair Bottom and Sonny Chair Top) which have a parent index of `1` aka `schair`.

The hierarchy we end up with is:

```
schair_dummy
    └── schair
        ├── schrbot
        └── schrtop
```

If we use the same approach as we used in [part 1](/_posts/2026-03-12-the-trilogy-godot-edition-part-1-model-loading.md) of this series to import the model into Godot we expect the following, very similar, output hierarchy.

```
Node3D
└── schair_dummy
    └── schair
        ├── schrbot
        └── schrtop
```

And here it is `schair` in Godot.

Fun fact, GTA: III doesn't make use of skinned meshes for their animated characters, but instead relies on a hierarchy of geometries to construct it's models. So here is a little screenshot of Claude:
