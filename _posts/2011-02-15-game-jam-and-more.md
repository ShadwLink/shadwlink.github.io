It’s been a couple of busy weeks lately. After a nice holiday (2 weeks ago I went skiing in Austria) I started my Game Technology Minor.

After one day it was clear it wouldn’t be an easy couple of months and I wouldn’t have any time to work on anything GTA related.

**Game Jam**

This week the Game Jam started. The Game Jam is a project where you’ve got to create a fully working game within 5 days. The theme of this years Game Jam is “Casual”. You can follow the progress of this game on it’s [project page](/games/kings-shadows).

**Team Game**

The team game will be a full game, made in a team of 6 persons (Same team as the Game Jam project) and will take 5 months to finish. No project page has been made for this yet. I’ll make a new post when it’s up 🙂
