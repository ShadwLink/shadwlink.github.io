The engine I am building for Ocarina of Time is also able to load Majora’s Mask, the two games use pretty much the same file structure. Even though I love this game and I like the dark atmosphere a lot. I won’t be doing anything to optimize the engine for this game. In my opinion MM’s gameplay doesn’t fit VR very well. The Deku, Goron and Zora masks have powers that I think don’t work in VR without getting nauseous (swimming, rolling and hopping). But I still wanted to share a screenshot with you guys.
