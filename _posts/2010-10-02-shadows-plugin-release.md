Finally after having to postpone the release a lot I came to the conclusion to just release it and life with the current bugs.

Now everyone can atleast enjoy my scripts and I will not be stressed to release it!

What’s in the download package?

- SL\_Model.dll
- SL\_Utils.dll
- SL\_Common.dll
- SL\_IV.dll
- Nini.dll
- ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll
- ShadowScript.mse
- hashes.ini
- Readme.txt

What will you be able to do?

- Import WDR, WDD, WBD and WBN files.
- <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Export WDR files.</span>

I am sorry for all the people that are waiting for the other export functions. I’ll be working on those for the next couple of days and release them asap. If you find any bugs in this script. You are free to add me on MSN, send me an email or join me on GTAnets irc.

For now head over to [the project page](http://shadow-link.nl/sl_nl_3/?page_id=161) and get ready to finally get some proper models ingame!
