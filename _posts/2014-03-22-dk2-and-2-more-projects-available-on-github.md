Just got back from my holiday to the Dominican Republic. It was awesome and I’d like to go back there some day! When I got back there was a nice surprise waiting for me, just a couple of hours after I landed the Oculus Rift DK2 got available fro pre-order. I immediately pre-ordered and I am now playing the waiting game again!

There where a couple of requests to open source 2 more projects. I feel ashamed to put the source up (it’s that bad), but maybe someone will learn something from it. You can now find the source of my [sco (de)compiler](https://github.com/ShadwLink/ShadowSCO) and the source of my [Sketchup OpenIV Exporter](https://github.com/ShadwLink/Sketchup2IV) on GitHub. I hope someone will find it interesting and can learn something from it.
