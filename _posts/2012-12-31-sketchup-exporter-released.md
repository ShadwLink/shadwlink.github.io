First of all I would like to whish you all a happy new year!

I’ve released the sketchup exporter for IV. Head over to the [project page](/tools/sketchup2gta) to try it out. It’s able to export ODR, OBD, IDE and WPL files. I’ve also provided a little tutorial and test scene to guide you through the export process. If something is still not clear, please let me know. It’s far from perfect, so if you find any bugs or have suggestions to improve the exporter let me know in the comments.

Enjoy and again all the best whishes for 2013!
