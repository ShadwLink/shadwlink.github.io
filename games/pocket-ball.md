## Summary
Pocket ball is a mix of pool and king of the hill. Every pocket on the table can be claimed by a player. The amount of balls in a pocket indicate the current score. When all the balls have been pocketed the game is over, the player that owns the highest amount of pocketed balls wins the game.

## Requirements
- A  pool table

Depending on the type of table:

_Table that keeps the balls in the pockets:_
- A different colored chip for every player (we use beer caps)

_Table that returns a pocketed ball:_
- A stack of 9 chips in the same color for every player (every player should have its own color).

## Getting started

### Decide the player  order
You can choose any method you want to determine the order of the players. We usually decide this by letting everyone shoot a ball and the player who gets the ball closest to the nearer end rail starts, then the second closest etc...

## The rules

### Claiming a pocket
When a pocket is unclaimed the first player to put a ball in the pocket claims the pocket. The color of the ball doesn't matter as long as it's not the white or 8-ball.

Once you claimed a pocket you put one of your colored chips next to the pocket. This indicates that the pocket is now yours.

> **If you are playing on a table where the balls don't stay in their pocket.**
> 
> For every ball that you put in this pocket you add a chip to your stack to indicate the amount of balls that are currently in that pocket.

### Pocketing a ball in a claimed pocket
If you pocket a ball in a claimed pocket that is yours, lucky you. You just scored another point.
Did you pocket a ball in a pocket claimed by someone else? You just gave your opponent a point.

### Stealing a pocket
Of course claimed pockets can be stolen. By pocketing the 8-ball in a claimed pocket, the pocket becomes yours. 

> **Warning**
> 
> Pocketing the 8-ball in your own pocket will free up that pocket for anyone else, so be careful!

## FAQ
_What happens if you pocket a ball, but also pocket the white ball?_

The ball will stay in the pocket, but goes into an unclaimed state.
