I've been working on a C# reimplementation of the GTA: 3D era engine as a side project for the past few years.

**Goal**

I am not trying to create perfect copy (we got reverse engineered versions for that), just my own simplistic version that can parse most of the files and play missions.

**Status**

Currently, the project can render the III and VC map, play animations and run a big part of the main script (with a lot of missing opcodes) and run cutscenes. With some of those things working better than others.

**Media**

A few years ago I've created and uploaded a couple of short clips that showed the first progress. They can be found on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Kielevent/playlists).
